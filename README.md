# Projects
***
This folder contains different projects which I have done in order to practice newly learnt coding and data analysis related stuff. Over time, the number of files here will increase. The following subsections, named after the respective file names, elaborate on the nature of each project.

## dictTrainerProg.py
A (tiny) dictionary trainer program, most of which was coded during a single morning, and the first mini-program I have ever written. Functionalities include:
* Vocab practice mode: word is shown, user prompted to enter translation, feedback given. If answer was correct, word is dropped from the practice round, otherwise it will be shown again.
* Vocab test mode: same as above, but if the user entered the wrong translation, (s)he gets no 2nd chance to get it right. At the end, a test result is shown.
* Viewing, adding and deleting vocab. Changes to the vocab (as well as previous fails) are recorded and written to file prior to the user exiting the program.
* User input validation provided to avoid breakdowns.
